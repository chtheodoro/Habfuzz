New features in HABFUZZ 2.8

1. The fuzzy set parameters are now handled using the
   STEERING file, located in the steering folder
2. HABFUZZ now asks wether the user will run the classic version
   or the full fuzzy version (see below and the Readme_first file) 
3. There are two STEERING files, one for the classic
   HABFUZZ with 5-5-8-5 (fuzzy-fuzzy-crisp-fuzzy) inputs
   (3 fuzzy variables with five fuzzy sets each +
   1 crisp variable with eight classes) and 
   one for the full fuzzy 5-5-5-5 HABFUZZ version with 4 fuzzy
   variables and five fuzzy sets (membership functions)
   per variable.
4. No FORTRAN compiler required and no recompilation unless you
   need to change the source code. HABFUZZ is now completely
   stand-alone
5. Bugs fixed
